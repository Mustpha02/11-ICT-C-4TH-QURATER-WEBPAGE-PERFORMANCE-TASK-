				<h1 style="text-align: center">Brief Preview</h1>
				<p>I have learned most of my skills through my Father. Whenever there is a project he needs to do I tag along and listen to what he says and do. I have tried all kinds of DIYs from constructing beds, strengthening ladder legs to micro-soldering, welding, curcuit analysis, and computer coding. I have always had the affinity to all kinds of grindwork, and this could have had an effect to my lack emotional control.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="sbs5"> 
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Coding - </h1>
				<p>This is what I could say is my most prominent and impressive skill I possess. Coding of any kind is intolerant to anyone with a short fuse, but somehow, I see code as easy as color matching. This is one of the best advantages to having what I call "Automative Cognition".</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="sbs5">
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Media Editing -</h1>
				<p>Video or Image editing is quite simple in my eyes, whatever software I can get my hands on that requires navigating through built-in tools I can just commit to memory as recognition. Though having your own format or style of editing is important, having an assortment of styles you can use is more on advantageous.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="sbs">
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Carpentry -</h1>
				<p>This I learned from my Father unintentionally, figuring out the load bearing beam and which tool is right for the job was second nature for me according to my Father. Building Vents and crafting beds were the highlights of my experience while making custom handles count as my worst area of experience.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="sbs">
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Circuit Diagnosis -</h1>
				<p>A more discrete trait I use in daily life is essential for this skill. Extreme observancy made me realize that I can determine items from a broken component to a deficit diagram. This includes PC motherboards, water-related electronics, Arduino boards, and audio periphirals.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="sbs">
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Soldering -</h1>
				<p>For me, Solid soldering is more my pace and have more comfort in doing. Microsoldering is an area of exepertise I dare not Trounch upon without proper tools and equipment. Soldering has been a delight in repair since a simple blown capacitor or short-circuited connection is an easier repair than a new unit for replacement.</p>
			</div>
		</div><div class="sbs">
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Welding -</h1>
				<p>Something I have done in recent times as of February 09,2026. From reinforcing, sealing holes, and building a strong bond between two pieces, I can say that I am able to complete a weld with precision proffesionalism. (sidenote: painting a large area, and watching it dry is suprisingly meditative)</p>
			</div>

		<div class="sbs">
			<div class="hob">
				<h1>Software Application Mastery -</h1>
				<p>I have always wondered if I was too quick to pick up certain mannerisms but it turned out that I was always just a quick learner on top of it. Quick code overview or directory recalling just seemed all too familiar for myself, Never had I wondered how or why I couldn't find what i was looking for by pure chance or coincidence.</p>
