 <h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  Hi, my name is Nasber Y. Edjick. I am 20 years old and I currently live in Villa Sta. Maria, Purok 8. I was born in Malaysia on November 11, 2005. I am a simple and hardworking person who is always trying to improve myself. In my free time, I enjoy playing Mobile Legends and watching anime because they help me relax and make me happy. Through these hobbies, I learn about teamwork, strategy, and different life lessons from the stories and characters. I value my family and friends, and I always try to be kind and respectful to others. Even though I still have many dreams to achieve, I am determined to work hard and become a better version of myself every day.
